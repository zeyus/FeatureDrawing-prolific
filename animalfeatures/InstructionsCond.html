            <p>In each trial of this experiment, you will be presented with four images of an animal on the screen. One of the images will be outlined with a red box. Your task is to make a drawing of this animal.</p>
            <p>Later, another participant will see your drawing and will have to guess which behaviour among four choices (ordered in a different way) the animal was exhibiting, e.g. walking, running, lying down, or stretching. In other words, it is important that you draw in a way that assist your receiver in making the right choice. Only drawing is allowed (no letters/words).</p>

            <p>In each trial of this experiment, you will be presented with four images of animals on the screen. One of the images will be outlined with a red box. Your task is to make a drawing of this animal.</p>
            <p>Later, another participant will see your drawing and will have to rate it on a scale for its aesthetic qualities. In other words, it is important that you draw in a way that makes the animal pleasing to the eye of the receiver. Only drawing is allowed (no letters/words).</p>
