You will be making line drawings of particular animal species (bison, horses, deer, and ibexes). By comparing drawings produced under different instructions, we seek to investigate variations in how visual information in drawings is distributed relative to their function. These experimental observations can assist us in making inferences about the original intentions behind cave art from the Upper Palaeolithic.</p>" +
